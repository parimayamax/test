Q: I am using Apache web server and .htaccess redirection is not working when
   connecting through https:// .

A: SSL (https) is probably configured as a VirtualHost, and 'AllowOverride All'
   will need to be added to the VirtualHost section.


Q: I am using Apache web server and get 404 errors for URLs with %2F (encoded
   forward slash) in them.

A: Add the following line to Apache httpd conf in the server or virtual host
   section. (Note: There are security risks associated with doing this.) :
   AllowEncodedSlashes On


Q: The diagnostics report.php never returns and the web page times out.

A: One of the final tests is a connection test to the FileMaker Server. If a
   firewall is preventing access to the FileMaker Server Web Publishing service,
   then the connection will hang.


Q: Is it possible to restrict the fields returned when GETting a resource ?

A. The FileMaker PHP API does not provide this feature, every field is returned
   even if it does not contain data. It is recommended that a custom layout be
   created with only the required fields.
